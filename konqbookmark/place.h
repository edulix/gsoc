         * bookmark) should  not be null. Note also that this Place won't take
         * ownership of those items so it's up to you to remove them when needed.
         * Note that even if the user visited this place at least once, we might
         * not have a KonqHistoryEntry to refer to it because it might have
         * already expired.
